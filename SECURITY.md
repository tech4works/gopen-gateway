## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously. If you've discovered a security vulnerability within our API Gateway, we appreciate your help in responsibly reporting it to us.

Publicly disclosing a vulnerability could put the entire community at risk, so we ask that you not share such information until we've had a chance to address it.

Please send us a confidential report via email to gabrielcataldo.adm@gmail.com. We'll work with you to ensure that we fully understand the issue and can address it as rapidly as possible. We treat each report as a top priority.

## Security Related Configuration

API Gateways control traffic to your microservices, so make sure they are configured in a way that minimizes security risks. Here are some tips:

- Enable authentication and authorization to protect sensitive data.
- Limit the visibility of internal networks, consider using private endpoints or VPCs.
- Make sure your API Gateway uses HTTPS with up-to-date TLS configurations to protect data in transit.
- Be aware of and avoid common security pitfalls, such as injection attacks.

## Our Commitment

We're committed to taking all necessary measures to promptly address security-related issues. We'll keep you informed throughout the process.

By working together, we can strengthen the security of the entire open-source ecosystem.

Please, DO NOT share vulnerabilities publicly. Reach out to us via gabrielcataldo.adm@gmail.com.
